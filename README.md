# Startup Page (Vue)

# What is Startup Page?
The Startup Page is a landing page that you can use whenever you open your browser for the first time.

I originally developed this using basic HTML and JS with jQuery, but now I want to update it.

I am using the following:
- Vue.js
- Axios

I also want to develop more functionality, such as opening customizing the different sections of links and making the page more responsive.

# Original Project
Please see [this](https://github.com/karuffin1992/startupPage) for the original project.

# Motivation
I wanted to learn Vue.js, so I decided to refactor my existing project from vanilla JS to Vue.js

## Project setup
```
npm install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
```
npm run serve
```
